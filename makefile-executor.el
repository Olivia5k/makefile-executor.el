;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A set of tools aimed at working with Makefiles on a project level.
;;
;; Currently available:
;; - Interactively selecting a make target and running it.
;;   Bound to 'C-c C-e' when 'makefile-executor-mode' is enabled.
;; - Re-running the last execution.  We usually run things in
;;   Makefiles many times after all!  Bound to '`C-c C-c'` in `makefile-mode` when
;;   'makefile-executor-mode'` is enabled.
;; - Running a makefile target in a dedicated buffer.  Useful when
;;   starting services and other long-running things!  Bound to
;;   '`C-c C-d'` in `makefile-mode` when 'makefile-executor-mode'` is enabled.
;; - Calculation of variables et.c.; $(BINARY) will show up as what it
;;   evaluates to.
;; - If `projectile' is installed, execution from any buffer in a
;;   project.  If more than one is found,
;;   an interactive prompt for one is shown.  This is added to the
;;   `projectile-commander' on the 'm' key.
;;
;; To enable it, use the following snippet to add the hook into 'makefile-mode':
;;
;; (add-hook 'makefile-mode-hook 'makefile-executor-mode)
;;
